# 🧮 Calculator in Python + Tkinter

> “Between numbers and clicks, I discovered that math can have a soul too.”

## 💡 About the Project

A simple, intuitive, and functional calculator built with **Python** and **Tkinter**.  
It was born from the desire to **create something visual** — something that responds,  
not only with numbers, but with purpose.

The focus was on learning how to organize interface elements,  
handle events (`command`, `lambda`),  
and see how pure logic can turn into design.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- 🐍 **Python 3.10+**  
- 🪟 **Tkinter** – Python’s native GUI library
